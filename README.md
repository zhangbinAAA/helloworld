Well I wonder could it be
　　When I was dreaming about you baby
　　You were dreaming of me
　　Call me crazy
　　Call me blind
　　To still be suffering is stupid after all of this time
　　Did I lose my love to someone better
　　And does she love you like I do
　　I do, you know I really really do
　　Well hey
　　So much I need to say
　　Been lonely since the day
　　The day you went away
　　So sad but true
